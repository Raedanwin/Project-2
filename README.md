Technologies Used: 
  I used EJS and CSS for my front-end and Express, MongoDB and Mongoose for my back-end.

Approach Taken: 
  1. I started by getting all my routes (for the pantry) set up and working.
  2. Then once they worked properly I moved everything into their own folders/files and set up my controllers and EJS files.
  3. I then made the routes and did the same for my recipe book.
  4. I made a partials file and added my styles and constant links to everything I needed in that.
  5. Then I tried to implement the API to get the real functionality of the app in place.
  6. I got the search function working and was able to find and save recipes into my recipe book database.
  7. And lastly, I pushed everything to Heroku and got it working there.

Unsolved Problems: 

Technical Challenges: 
  1. By far my biggest technical challenge was figuring out how to use and implement the API.
  2. Another was getting everything to connect together in the way I wanted.
  
Improvements I Would Make: 
  1. I would add more to the recipe and ingredient show pages to give more depth to the information the user recieves.
  2. I would make the search process/results more interactive to give the user more control over exactly what's happening.
  3. I would add more style and make it easier on the eyes/easier to navigate and understand.
